Design Patterns in PHP for educational purposes

**Decorator Pattern** - In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern

**Adapter Pattern** - (also known as wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.[1] It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern
